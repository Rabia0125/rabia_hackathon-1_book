# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: ✅ All checklist items pass

**Spec Quality Summary**:
- 3 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 35 functional requirements organized by chapter
- 8 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 8 assumptions documented
- 10 out-of-scope items clearly defined
- 4 edge cases with mitigation strategies
- 6 key entities defined

**Ready for**: `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`

No issues found - specification is complete and ready for the next phase.
